# Franka-arm-Telecontrol-via-Meta-Quest
 
## Real-Time VR Teleoperation of a Franka Arm for Construction Automation and Human-Robot Interaction

This repository contains the full codebase, setup instructions, and supporting files for a real-time, Linux-based VR teleoperation system. Built during a research internship at the University of Alberta, the system enables precise and intuitive control of a Franka Emika Research 3 robot arm using a Meta Quest 2 headset.

## 🔧 System Overview

The project demonstrates an open-source, low-latency telecontrol pipeline with:
- Unity-based Meta Quest 2 pose streaming (6DoF) via ALVR + SteamVR
- ROS 2 Humble running on a Jetson Nano (real-time kernel)
- Real-time control of the Franka Emika arm using `franka_ros2` and custom ROS 2 nodes

## 🚀 Key Technologies

- **Hardware**: Meta Quest 2, Franka Emika FR3, Jetson Orin Nano
- **Software**: ROS 2 Humble, Unity 2022, ALVR, SteamVR, libfranka
- **Networking**: USB-C for headset tracking, Ethernet between Jetson and Franka

## 🧠 What This System Solves

- ❌ Eliminates reliance on expensive, Windows-only VR toolchains  
- ✅ Fully Linux-based, low-latency XR control (< 20 ms)
- ✅ Precise pose tracking for millimeter-level brick and sensor placement
- ✅ Easily reproducible by other labs for training or site automation
